    <h1>Bauhaus</h1>

    <p>The <strong>Staatliches Bauhaus</strong>, commonly known as the <strong>Bauhaus</strong>, was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined 
        crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught.</p>

    <p>The Bauhaus was founded by <em>Walter Gropius</em> in Weimar. The German term <em>Bauhaus</em>, literally <i>"building house"</i>, was understood as meaning 
        "School of Building", but in spite of its name and the fact that its founder was an architect, the Bauhaus did not initially have an architecture department. 
        Nonetheless, it was founded upon the idea of creating a <i lang= "ger">Gesamtkunstwerk</i> ("total work of art") in which all the arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. </p>
        
    <p>The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, <em>Modernist architecture</em> and art, design, and architectural
         education. The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial 
         design, and typography.</p>

    <p>The school existed in three German cities: Weimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933â€”under three different 
        architect-directors: <em>Walter Gropius</em> from 1919 to 1928; <em>Hannes Meyer</em> from 1928 to 1930; and <em>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</em> from 1930 until
         1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. 
        Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.</p>

    <p>The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop
         was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when <em>Mies van der Rohe</em> took 
         over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school and would not allow any supporters of <em>Hannes Meyer</em> to attend it. </p>
